    <h1>Rob's Baked Salmon and Roasted Vegetable Recipe</h1>
    <p><h2>Ingredients:</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Salmon Filet</li>
        <li>Yellow Potatoes</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>3 Garlic Cloves, Finely Minced</li>
        <li>1/2 Shallot, Finely Minced</li>
        <li>6 Tablespoons of Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to Taste</li>
        <li>Italian Parsley (garnish)</li>
        <li>Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese (optional)</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps:</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by peeling potatos and chopping into 1-2 inch cubes (choose a consistent size); preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        <li>At the same time, in a different pot, bring 6-8 cups of water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Boil potatoes for about 20 minutes or until fork tender (tip: add a teaspoon of baking soda for extra fluffy potatoes).</li>
        <li>Strain potatoes and set aside; bring 4 tablespoons of the oil to a medium-low heat in saute pan; set aside remaining 2 tablespoons of oil for salmon.</li>
        <li>Mix in shallots and garlic and saute until fragrant and color begins to turn light golden brown and lightly crispy, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat, strain garlic and shallot oil through a fine mesh strainer; set crispy garlic and shallots aside for garnish later.</li>
        <li>Gently toss potatoes in infused oil, season with salt and pepper and toss into oven for 1 hour, but pull potatoes out halfway through to turn.</li>
        <li>Prepare salmon - coat in remaining oil and season with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>When potatoes come out midway for their turn, add carrots and salmon to baking pan (optional: add grated cheese to potatoes or salmon).</li>
        <li>Bake for another 20-30 minutes or until salmon reaches an internal temperature of 130 degrees F. </li>
    </ol>
