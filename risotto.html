    <h1>Rob's Risotto Recipe</h1>
    <p><h2>Ingredients:</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 Cups of Arborio Rice</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese</li>
        <li>6 Cups of Chicken Broth</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup of Finely Chopped Shallot</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of Olive Oil (or butter)</li>
        <li>2 Cloves of Finely Chopped Garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup of White Wine</li>
        <li>Handful of Chopped Italian Parsley (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to Taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps:</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in saute pan on medium-low.</li>
        <li>At the same time, in a different pot, bring chicken broth to a near boil.</li>
        <li>Pour in shallots and garlic into saute pan and saute for a few minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Mix in dry Arborio Rice and 'toast' rice for about 3 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Mix in white wine and allow it to reduce, about 3-5 minutes until it halves in volume.</li>
        <li>Turn heat up to medium-high and pour in 1 cup of chicken broth and stir continuously until broth evaporates.</li>
        <li>Once broth evaporate, pour in more chicken broth just enough to cover the rice, stir continuously until it evaporates.</li>
        <li>Repeat the above step until rice grain turns opaque, about 20 minutes or so and validate by tasting a rice grain - the texture should be cooked but have a light firmness to it.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat and mix in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
        <li>Garnish with more cheese and chopped Italian Parsley.</li>
    </ol>
