# odin-recipes

Introduction: This project is my first attempt at creating a recipes website - it probably won't look pretty but it's a stepping stone in my progression. 

Date: 12/24/21

Skills demonstrated: 
1. creating a new repo on GitHub
2. connecting the repo to Git 
3. making edits through the command line to the files (including this read me)
